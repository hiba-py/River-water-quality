Hello Hiba

Below is the feedback. Please note that I only check your code. I have no time to check your code explanation.

Before I run the code, I fixed two small issues. I wonder how you run it on your PC.
I checked your code, looks fine. I run your code, each feature runs correctly. That's good.
I am not able to understand extract_river_data() completely. When I mark it, I will check it again by referencing your explanation.

Good job. Have a good night.
